abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recently released Infinium HumanMethylation450 array (the '450k' array) provides a high-throughput assay to quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) at ∼450 000 loci across a range of genomic features. Although less comprehensive than high-throughput sequencing-based techniques, this product is more cost-effective and promises to be the most widely used DNAm high-throughput measurement technology over the next several years.

RESULTS: Here we describe a suite of computational tools that incorporate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the analysis of DNAm data. The software is structured to easily adapt to future versions of the technology. We include methods for preprocessing, quality assessment and detection of differentially methylated regions from the kilobase to the megabase scale. We show how our software provides a powerful and flexible development platform for future methods. We also illustrate how our methods empower the technology to make discoveries previously thought to be possible only with sequencing-based methods.

The new high density BeadChip can assay over 480K CpG sites and analyze twelve samples in parallel. The innovative content includes coverage of 99{\%} of RefSeq genes with multiple probes per gene, 96{\%} of CpG islands from the UCSC database, CpG island shores and additional content selected from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data and input from DNA methylation experts. The well-characterized Infinium{\textregistered} Assay is used for analysis of CpG methylation using bisulfite-converted genomic DNA. We applied this technology to analyze DNA methylation in normal and tumor DNA samples and compared results with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained for the same samples. Highly comparable DNA methylation profiles were generated by the array and sequencing methods (average R2 of 0.95). The ability to determine genome-wide methylation patterns will rapidly advance methylation research.},

@article{Gagnon-Bartsch2012,
abstract = {Microarray expression studies suffer from the problem of batch effects and other unwanted variation. Many methods have been proposed to adjust microarray data to mitigate the problems of unwanted variation. Several of these methods rely on factor analysis to infer the unwanted variation from the data. A central problem with this approach is the difficulty in discerning the unwanted variation from the biological variation that is of interest to the researcher. We present a new method, intended for use in differential expression studies, that attempts to overcome this problem by restricting the factor analysis to negative control genes. Negative control genes are genes known a priori not to be differentially expressed with respect to the biological factor of interest. Variation in the expression levels of these genes can therefore be assumed to be unwanted variation. We name this method "Remove Unwanted Variation, 2-step" (RUV-2). We discuss various techniques for assessing the performance of an adjustment method and compare the performance of RUV-2 with that of other commonly used adjustment methods such as Combat and Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We present several example studies, each concerning genes differentially expressed with respect to gender in the brain and find that RUV-2 performs as well or better than other methods. Finally, we discuss the possibility of adapting RUV-2 for use in studies not concerned with differential expression and conclude that there may be promise but substantial challenges remain.},

@book{Gagnon-Bartsch2013,
abstract = {High dimensional data suffer from unwanted variation, such as the batch effects common in microarray data. Unwanted variation complicates the analysis of high dimensional data, leading to high rates of false discoveries, high rates of missed discoveries, or both. In many cases the factors causing the unwanted variation are unknown and must be inferred from the data. In such cases, negative controls may be used to identify the unwanted variation and separate it from the wanted variation. We present a new method, RUV-4, to adjust for unwanted variation in high dimensional data with negative controls. RUV-4 may be used when the goal of the analysis is to determine which of the features are truly associated with a given factor of interest. One nice property of RUV-4 is that it is relatively insensitive to the number of unwanted factors included in the model; this makes estimating the number of factors less critical. We also present a novel method for estimating the features' variances that may be used even when a large number of unwanted factors are included in the model and the design matrix is full rank. We name this the “inverse method for estimating variances.” By combining RUV-4 with the inverse method, it is no longer necessary to estimate the number of unwanted factors at all. Using both real and simulated data we compare the performance of RUV-4 with that of other adjustment methods such as SVA, LEAPP, ICE, and RUV-2. We find that RUV-4 and its variants perform as well or better than other methods.},

@article{Geeleher2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that can stably repress gene expression. Because of its biological and clinical significance, several methods have been developed to compare genome-wide patterns of methylation between groups of samples. The application of gene set analysis to identify relevant groups of genes that are enriched for differentially methylated genes is often a major component of the analysis of these data. This can be used, for example, to identify processes or pathways that are perturbed in disease development. We show that gene-set analysis, as it is typically applied to genome-wide methylation assays, is severely biased as a result of differences in the numbers of CpG sites associated with different classes of genes and gene promoters. RESULTS We demonstrate this bias using published data from a study of differential CpG island methylation in lung cancer and a dataset we generated to study methylation changes in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis. We show that several of the gene sets that seem enriched would also be identified with randomized data. We suggest two existing approaches that can be adapted to correct the bias. Accounting for the bias in the lung cancer and ulcerative colitis datasets provides novel biological insights into the role of methylation in cancer development and chronic inflammation, respectively. Our results have significant implications for many previous genome-wide methylation studies that have drawn conclusions on the basis of such strongly biased analysis.

@article{Hansen2011,
abstract = {Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other, suggesting that these cDMRs might be generalized across cancer types. Here we show stochastic methylation variation of the same cDMRs, distinguishing cancer from normal tissue, in colon, lung, breast, thyroid and Wilms' tumors, with intermediate variation in adenomas. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing shows these variable cDMRs are related to loss of sharply delimited methylation boundaries at CpG islands. Furthermore, we find hypomethylation of discrete blocks encompassing half the genome, with extreme gene expression variability. Genes associated with the cDMRs and large blocks are involved in mitosis and matrix remodeling, respectively. We suggest a model for cancer involving loss of epigenetic stability of well-defined genomic domains that underlies increased methylation variability in cancer that may contribute to tumor heterogeneity.},
